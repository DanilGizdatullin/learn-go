# Learn Go

## Introduction.
### 1. Compinling files
```
go build greet.go
```
to run the code
```
./greet
```

### 2. Running files
```
go run greet.go
```
`go run` does not create an executable file. 


### 3. Packages
`package main` - declaration that file is executable. It means this program will be compiled into an executable.

`import "fmt"` - example of package importing.
